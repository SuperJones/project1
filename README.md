Creating the game Concentration (aka Memory)

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Approach Taken:
-Solve for simple board of 2x2.
-make simple html boiler plate.
-hard code attributes into html
-add a little css, to make cards visible.
-decide what it meant to flip card: for every card, when clicked, add active class to represent current card choice, if two have active class, compare.
-once basic functionality works, add other functions.

Bronze:
[X]As a user I should be able to click on 2 different boxes so that colors can be revealed and I can see if they match.

-----------------------------------------
Silver:
[]As a user I should be able to choose between levels of difficulty so that I can test my memory with more cards.
[]As a user I should be able to race against the clock so that the game is more exciting/challenging.

Add Object oriented javascript principles.
Add levels with more cards.
------------------------------------------
Gold:
[]As a user I should be able to play the game against another person so that more people can enjoy the game.

Add card design
Add a side menu that allows for rules, restart button, and multiplayer, themes, and difficulty level buttons.
----------------------------------------

Unsolved Problems:
Design of cards needs enhancing.
Adding pictures instead of colors
Adding more cards and difficulty settings.
Making code more 'general' instead of hard coding so that I can add more functionality easily.
